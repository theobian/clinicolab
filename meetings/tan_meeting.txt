likelihood ratio
sensitivity specificity odds ratio
relative risk odds ratio and then associate it with feature importance
you need to understand the individual value of these predictors 

unadjusted prediction value of predictors then have multivariate analysis and see how the model adjusted to that: then have adjusted odds ratio 
un adjusted and adjusted odds ratio and p value
individual predictors = features
give information on how the features are: categorical, numerical, etc
can i dichotomize this? can i categorize this? before using it on the model.
