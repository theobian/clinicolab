explain validation and training sets!!!!
show which percentage was taken from it


temprature: sometimes its best to have it be binned instead of continuous.... 


every warning sign possible for people not knowledgeable about statistics!!! you can misinterpret everything

likelihood ratio
sensi specs odds ratio
relative risk odds ratio AND THEN associate it with featurs importance
You NEED to understand the individual value of these predictors
models information

unadjusted prediction value of predictors then have multivariate analysis and see how the model adjusted to that: then have adjusted odds ratio
un adjusted and adjusted odds ratio and p value
idv predictors = features
give info on hoe the features are : categorical numerical etc
can i dichotomize this or can I categorize this data before using it on the model

for example : temp. can we categorize it as just high and low instead of the actual numerical value


best for features odda ratio with CI and p value
all results in table
