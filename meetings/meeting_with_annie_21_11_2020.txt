rihda: EIXUZQ: in the midst of the pandemic, crazy stuff, so will be less perfect dataset but its still good for comparison
should just get his cleaned version of a dataset

focus on django and focus on 

diiive into interpretability! make sure you're really good at interpreting stuff and understanding interpretability of machine learning
go into the theory! the risk of the thesis: make 1 graph or two and this is nice. but needs the academic background.
it needs to be an investigation, it needs to be explained / reasoned. need to have pros and cons. It's not a report, 
it's an academic report! critical overview of both the state-of-the-art and on the work that I have done.
decisional process! needs to be understandable why we go from one part to another. for example, go from accuracy to pdp plots to ale plots to etc..



thesis writing:

scientific writing:
- organize thoughts: have tables, have subheadings, summarize things, have conclusions. needs to have a point. 
- argument: always trying to present both sides + eventually win the argument  / prove one of them right/ wrong
- really think about a section as heading + subheadings, to show what you know and have the academic part of the report be "seen"

background: overview
introduction: explain the setting 
then deep dive!

have a section for the survey: qualitative part of the study (not 100s of answers), talk about the process, the structures, the concerns that came 
up from the doctors answering that, the needs, and our responses + what we should do + what we can't do.


presentation: train vs test: but what is training ?:p
