INSTALLATION GUIDE or change that up

is it only running on local? put it on a website

record a DEMO
HOW TO GUIDE - needs to be short and concise and clear
MAKE SURE you use the malaria  label + malaria test in the predictor
SHOULD ReALLY FOCUS ON THE THING BELoW: ITS SUPER IMPORTANT FOR LOW RESROUCE CONTEXT DOCTORS
MAKE SURE you use the snesitivity specificty graph from Annie's paper; explain the slider = threshold; you're sacrificing accuracy but you're getting sensitivity as you want it (i want to capture 10 people e..g because i can't afford more)
	

make sure I AM LEARNING STUFF

models:
ebola dataset: Ridha will clean the dataset.

NEED TO DO: MAYBE DOESNT NEED TO BE INTEGRATED IN THE PLATFORM
- 1) slider specificity thing
- 2) general info and question mark thingies/ pimp out the platform
- 3) 1 interpretaion method: e.g. LIME or SHAP
