sasha:
click on shapley dot and have the same patient with LIME 
LIME: orient on the same way as SHAP, same ordering of features, etc
be able to explain lasso better jesus
bin scoring thing: useful in certain cases:: should specify if accuracy isnt good = not a good choice
(you can sort of see that from the graph itself)
make things more simple but add as many visualization tools as possible!
characterize patients within each severity score bin: feature importance, etc...
have more slides about the graphs interpretation! that's the most important
