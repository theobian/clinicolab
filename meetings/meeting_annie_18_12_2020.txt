meeting annie 18-12-2020

We can't really do the machine learning model comparison yet... 
on the platform , there is something wrong, the results are not great at all.
The fix Antoine attempted didnt seem to do much.
For comparison, the results i obtain 
Random forest: simple 
accuracy 0.9460122699386503 
precision 0.8245614035087719 
recall 0.9096774193548387
Only feature processing = minmax scaling, which is supposed to be done on the platform as well
When selecting the same features, the results are more like
89
2.1
60.0
which is terrible because the label class is very unbalanced (at least like 3:1?)
trying to find the bug but... tough

For now. wrote first parts, and a result part 
even though it is very messy, some stuff there. I ll continue to substitute and have
better looking sentences

django: on hold. I can add stuff that is just displayed there, but ... 
im spending too much time on it. I dont want it to be that much a part of my thesis...
like at the expense of the rest. I know it is important though, so ill continue working...
on it but I want to do some machine learning model stuff as well


more functionalities: focus on being able to get information from bin or one point 
and investigate further: sort of granular explanation.


ml stuff
- basically already did the tree forest comparison, need to do NN, NBB and LR
- even if the comparison point is off, some results to be used for later.

spoke with sasha, she seemed pleased. interested in the platform
very intersted in the tools i will describe to you
the binning stuff is good. Says maybe we need to display ONLY if model is good
but i think that should be up to the user to decide

still havent got a response from the two rwandan doctors, ill contact them again
were not on passive-agressive discussion, i really think they just forgot / have 
too much work

will speak to valerie on the 7th of january so that's one more. 

need to speak to ludovico to get the feedback survey

need to investigate rainer's papers more





AFTER MEETING
["date_season_meteo", "dem_age_int", "dem_sex", "lab_malaria_any_d0", "sign_pallor", "signv_temp_d0", \
	"symp_abdopain", "symp_cough", "symp_diarrhea", "symp_feveronly", "symp_fev24h", "symp_vomit", "signv_rr1_d0", "days_of_fever"]





- instaed of malaria_any choose malaria high and also compare it with malaria low and malaria rdt

- look into the integer rounding


- epoct comparison with another dataset

- akss ridha: for a cleaned dataset to do the same thing and compare
